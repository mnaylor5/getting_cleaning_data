# README.md

## The code in this repo reads in the data as downloaded and unzipped from the UCI study which measured tracker metrics from various activity levels.
##
## The user sets his/her working directory to wherever the zip file was extracted, and the code does the following:

1. Reads in the training and test data files.
2. Combines training and test files with labels that identify the activity performed and the resulting metric gathered by the activity tracker.
3. Alters the resulting dataset to conform to "tidy" standards.
